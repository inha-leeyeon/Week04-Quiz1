# Week02 Quiz1:

Please read the classroom documentation in detail！ 

## 1. Problem:

You are given a matrix of integers. Your task is to compute the sum of two specified elements in the matrix.

- Writing code using c++

### Input
1. The first line contains two integers **R** and **C** (1 ≤ R, C ≤ 1000), representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

2. The next **R** lines each contain **C** integers, separated by spaces. These lines represent the matrix elements. The elements are given in row-major order.

3. The following two lines each contain two integers **r** **c** (0 ≤ r < R, 0 ≤ c < C), representing the coordinates of the two elements in the matrix for which you need to compute the sum. Each line specifies the row and column of one element.

### Output
Print a single integer, which is the sum of the two specified elements.
